# Hashi Node Operator Runbook

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> How Sui validators join the Hashi committee, covering prerequisites, configuration, genesis, key management, governance, and monitoring for running a Hashi node.

This runbook is for **Sui validators joining the Hashi committee**. It covers prerequisites, configuration, genesis, ongoing operations, and governance.

Hashi is a Sui-native **asset orchestration protocol** that secures and manages native BTC for use on Sui through threshold cryptography. Committee members run the `hashi` service alongside their Sui validator to participate in MPC threshold Schnorr signing for Bitcoin custody. The committee collectively manages a Bitcoin master key, and no single validator ever holds the full key.

This is a **living document**. Hashi launches on Testnet first. This document adds Mainnet parameters to the [Networks](#networks) table below as the team finalizes them. Wherever the runbook shows a network-specific value, use the column for your **target network** (the worked examples use Testnet).

This document assumes familiarity with Sui validator operations, Linux system administration, and basic Bitcoin infrastructure.

## Networks

Hashi is network-specific: the Sui chain, the Bitcoin chain, and their endpoints all differ per deployment. The runbook's examples use **Testnet** (Sui Testnet + Bitcoin Signet); for any other network, substitute the values from this table. Adding a network later is just a matter of filling in a column here.

| Parameter | Testnet (current) | Mainnet |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Sui network | Testnet | Mainnet |
| `sui-chain-id` | `69WiPg3DAQiwdxfncX6wYQ2siKwAe6L9BZthQea3JNMD` | `4btiuiMPvEENsttpZC7CZ53DruC3MAgfznDbASZ7DR6S` |
| Sui public fullnode | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` |
| Bitcoin network | Signet | Mainnet |
| `bitcoin-chain-id` (genesis block hash) | `00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6` | `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f` |
| `[bitcoin].network` | `signet` | `mainnet` |
| Bitcoin RPC port (default) | 38332 | 8332 |
| Bitcoin P2P port (default) | 38333 | 8333 |
| `package-id` | `0xfcea10cadbb553c4874201584abf68771592678952efd957b2e82c010c7f4360` | _TBD_ |
| `hashi-object-id` | `0x22c0ce66ce09df2dc88a31bd320d4177b766518b9b88010368cfbdcd724528f8` | _TBD_ |

> A self-hosted Sui fullnode is reached at its RPC port (default `http://127.0.0.1:9000`) on any network. Hashi's built-in default for `bitcoin-rpc` is `http://localhost:8332` (the Mainnet port), so on Signet you must set the port explicitly.

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1 Resources

The requirements for running a Hashi node are **low** compared with those of a Sui node. To reduce blast radius, avoid **colocating** the Hashi process with a Sui validator. There should be no performance concerns with containerizing the process or running it in Kubernetes.

| Resource | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 3 cores |
| **Memory** | 2 GB |
| **Storage** | 10 GB persistent |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps NIC / link |

> **Sizing notes** (preliminary, derived from June test runs and pending revalidation after recent fixes):
>
> - **CPU**: 3 cores for headroom, mainly the parallel-signing burst on the leader.
> - **Memory**: 2 GB is comfortable headroom; steady-state is well under this (a one-off ~3.7 GB spike came from a since-identified bug, not normal load).
> - **Network**: ~66 Mbps ingress / ~40 Mbps egress with the default MPC `(t, f)` parameters; a higher-throughput ("hybrid") configuration likely needs considerably more, so provision a **1 Gbps** link for headroom. Bandwidth tracks MPC protocol rounds (DKG, key rotation, presigning, signing), not individual deposit/withdrawal transactions; egress can be a meaningful cost, and the team is actively reducing this.
> - **Storage**: peaks around 1 GB; 10 GB is generous but fine.
>
> These figures reflect Testnet observations and might change for Mainnet.

### 1.2 External service dependencies

A Hashi node depends on two external services that you provide:

- **Bitcoin node** for your target network, reachable on **both** P2P and JSON-RPC (default ports per the [Networks](#networks) table; Signet uses 38333 / 38332), running as a **full archival node** with:
  - `txindex=1` (Hashi calls `getrawtransaction` on arbitrary deposit txids)
  - `blockfilterindex=1` + `peerblockfilters=1` (BIP-157/158 compact block filter serving for the embedded light client)
  - `server=1` plus RPC auth
- **Sui fullnode serving the gRPC v2 API** (`sui.rpc.v2` services, including the `SubscribeCheckpoints` stream). The public fullnode works out of the box, or self-host one if you want isolation; see [1.4](#14-sui-rpc).

> Run both dependencies on separate infrastructure from the Hashi node, not colocated on the same host, so a fault or compromise in one does not cascade to the others.

See [1.4](#14-sui-rpc) and [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node) for details.

### 1.3 Software dependencies

**Hashi binary.** Build the Linux x86-64 binary with the deterministic Docker build. It compiles in a pinned, reproducible environment, extracts the binary, and writes its sha256:

```bash
# Reproducible build (requires Docker); writes out/hashi and out/hashi.sha256
bash docker/hashi/build.sh --no-cache
```

The build pins its base images, sets `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0`, links statically, and compiles `--frozen` with networking disabled, so it is bit-for-bit reproducible. CI confirms the same binary hash across runners. Each release publishes the sha256 of these deterministic binaries, so you can reproduce the build yourself and confirm your binary matches the published checksum:

```bash
sha256sum -c out/hashi.sha256
```

**Backup tooling.** Node backups are **OpenPGP** (Sequoia). To generate a backup key and decrypt backups you need an OpenPGP toolchain:

- `gpg` + `gpg-agent`, for decrypting backups, including with a YubiKey (works over a forwarded `gpg-agent` socket so you can restore on a server using a YubiKey plugged into your laptop)
- Optionally [Sequoia `sq`](https://sequoia-pgp.org/) (local keys) or [`oct` / openpgp-card-tools](https://gitlab.com/openpgp-card/openpgp-card) (YubiKey key generation)

See the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide for the full key-generation procedure.

### 1.4 Sui RPC

Hashi connects to Sui over the **gRPC v2 API (gRPC over HTTP/2)**, **not** JSON-RPC. The fullnode must expose the `sui.rpc.v2` services, including the **streaming `SubscriptionService`** (`subscribe_checkpoints`) the node uses to follow the chain. A fullnode that serves only JSON-RPC does not work.

| Setup | `sui-rpc` value | Transport |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Public Sui Foundation fullnode | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | gRPC over TLS (443) |
| Self-hosted fullnode (separate host) | `http://<fullnode-host>:9000` | plaintext gRPC/h2c (default 9000) |

Point `sui-rpc` at any fullnode serving `sui.rpc.v2` plus the `SubscribeCheckpoints` stream. The public fullnode (`https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`) serves everything Hashi requires and works out of the box; self-host a fullnode if you want isolation from shared infrastructure. The node verifies the endpoint's reported chain ID matches `sui-chain-id` at startup and refuses to start on mismatch.

Set `sui-chain-id` and `sui-rpc` to match your target network, as shown in the [Networks](#networks) table.

### 1.5 Bitcoin node

Hashi talks to Bitcoin over **two independent channels**, both of which must be reachable:

1. **P2P**: an embedded [Kyoto](https://github.com/rustaceanrob/kyoto) BIP-157 light client connects over P2P to fetch headers, **compact block filters (BIP-158)**, and full blocks. This requires the serving node to advertise filters (`peerblockfilters=1`) and build the index (`blockfilterindex=1`).
2. **JSON-RPC**: used for transaction lookup (`getrawtransaction`), fee estimation (`estimatesmartfee`), UTXO checks (`gettxout`), chain info (`getblockchaininfo`), and **broadcasting withdrawals (`sendrawtransaction`)**.

For the **JSON-RPC** channel you can run your own archival Signet node or use a verified RPC provider such as [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) (or another provider that serves Bitcoin Signet). Whichever you choose, the endpoint must be **archival** (Hashi calls `getrawtransaction` on arbitrary deposit txids) and must permit `sendrawtransaction`.

The **P2P / BIP-157** channel (the embedded light client's compact-filter sync) needs a peer that serves filters (`peerblockfilters=1`). Run your own Signet node for this, or use a provider that exposes Signet P2P with compact-filter serving. The simplest setup that satisfies both channels is a single self-hosted archival Signet node.

**RPC methods Hashi calls** (so you can scope RPC permissions): `getrawtransaction` (verbose), `sendrawtransaction`, `estimatesmartfee`, `gettxout`, `getblockchaininfo`, `getblockheader` (verbose). Hashi requires **Bitcoin Core v29 or newer**; the latest release works fine.

**`bitcoin.conf`, run as an archival, non-pruned node** (Signet shown; for another network use its ports and network flag from the [Networks](#networks) table):

```ini
# Hashi Testnet — Bitcoin SIGNET serving node
# ARCHIVAL: do NOT set prune=

signet=1
server=1
txindex=1               # getrawtransaction on arbitrary deposit txids
blockfilterindex=1      # build BIP-158 compact block filter index
peerblockfilters=1      # serve BIP-157 filters to the embedded light client
listen=1                # accept P2P (Signet default port 38333)

# JSON-RPC auth — use rpcauth (hashed) in production, or rpcuser/rpcpassword
rpcuser=YOUR_RPC_USER
rpcpassword=YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD
# rpcauth=YOUR_RPC_USER:SALT$HASH      # generate with Bitcoin Core's rpcauth.py

[signet]
bind=0.0.0.0:38333                     # P2P
rpcbind=127.0.0.1:38332                # JSON-RPC (Signet default port)
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1                   # restrict to where Hashi runs
```

The corresponding Hashi config pointers (full template in [3.1](#31-validator-config)):

```toml
bitcoin-chain-id = "00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6"  # signet genesis
bitcoin-rpc = "http://127.0.0.1:38332"            # Hashi's own default is 8332 — you MUST override it
bitcoin-trusted-peers = ["127.0.0.1:38333"]       # host:port (port is mandatory)
# bitcoin-start-height = <a height at/below the first relevant Signet deposit>

[bitcoin-rpc-auth]
UserPass = ["YOUR_RPC_USER", "YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD"]
```

> Notes: ports `38332` (RPC) / `38333` (P2P) are Bitcoin Core **Signet** defaults. Hashi does not default to them (its default `bitcoin-rpc` is `http://localhost:8332`), so set them explicitly. The light client runs in *whitelist-only* mode and connects **only** to `bitcoin-trusted-peers`, so that list must be correct and reachable. `bitcoin-start-height` defaults to `800000` (Mainnet-oriented); set it for Signet so the light client does not skip early deposits.

**Verify your node:**

```bash
bitcoin-cli -signet getblockchaininfo | grep '"chain"'    # must be "signet"
bitcoin-cli -signet getindexinfo                          # block filter index present
bitcoin-cli -signet getnetworkinfo                        # NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS advertised
```

## 2. Key management and security

### 2.1 Keys overview

| Key | Algorithm | Provisioning | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Sui validator account key** | Any Sui scheme (Ed25519, multisig, secp256k1, zkLogin) | Existing (Sui validator) | Authorizes initial Hashi **registration**. See [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key). |
| **TLS private key** | Ed25519 | Generate fresh (dedicated) | Peer-to-peer authentication through a self-signed cert. The node registers the public key onchain. |
| **Operator private key** | Ed25519 | Generate fresh | Signs the node's day-to-day Sui transactions (cert submission, governance, metadata). See [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing). |
| **BLS12-381 key** | BLS12-381 | Auto-generated at startup | MPC protocol participation. Stored in local DB. |
| **Encryption key** | ECIES | Auto-generated at startup | Encrypts MPC share exchange between validators. Stored in local DB. |
| **Backup key** | OpenPGP (Sequoia) | Operator-generated (file or YubiKey) | Encrypts automatic epoch backups. Strongly recommended. |

### 2.2 TLS key (dedicated)

Generate a fresh Ed25519 TLS key dedicated to your Hashi node, separate from your Sui validator's TLS key, for clean separation of concerns. This key authenticates your Hashi node to other committee members, and the node registers the corresponding public key onchain during registration. Set `tls-private-key` to a PKCS#8 PEM/DER file path or an inline PEM string:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out tls-private-key.pem
```

```toml
tls-private-key = "/path/to/tls-private-key.pem"
```

Make sure the file is readable by the user running `hashi` (for example, `chmod 600` owned by that user). `hashi register` needs it to include your TLS public key in the registration transaction.

> A planned enhancement is for the node to generate its TLS key on startup, removing this manual step.

### 2.3 Registration must be signed by the account key

Your **Sui validator account key must sign and broadcast the initial registration transaction.** Onchain, `validator::register` sets the member's `validator_address = ctx.sender()` and asserts the sender is in the Sui active validator set, so no operator key can substitute for this first transaction. Registration places no constraint on the account's key scheme (Ed25519, multisig, secp256k1, or zkLogin all work); it requires only that the sender is an active Sui validator.

Because that key is typically in cold storage or a hardware wallet, use the **offline signing flow**: `hashi register --print-only` builds the unsigned transaction and prints it as base64 **without needing any private key**. Sign it externally with the account key and broadcast.

```bash
# Emit the unsigned registration tx (no private key required)
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only

# Sign the printed base64 with the validator account key, then broadcast.
# If the account key lives in your local sui keystore:
sui keytool sign --address 0x<validator-address> --data <TX_BYTES_BASE64>
sui client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes <TX_BYTES_BASE64> --signatures <SIGNATURE_BASE64>
```

For hardware wallets or multisig accounts, produce the signature with your own signing tooling instead of `sui keytool sign`; the broadcast step is the same.

`--operator-address` is the Sui address of the **fresh operator key** you generate in [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing). It is **not** your validator address. Passing it here delegates day-to-day signing in the same transaction, so the validator account key can go straight back to cold storage.

> Do **not** rely on the plain `hashi register` (execute) path for the first registration unless your configured `operator-private-key` *is* the validator account key. The builder forces the sender to the validator address while the execute path signs with the operator key, producing a signer/sender mismatch.

### 2.4 Operator key (day-to-day signing)

Generate a fresh keypair for the operator and fund its address with SUI for gas. The running node (`hashi server`) signs **all** its day-to-day Sui transactions with this `operator-private-key`: MPC certificate submission, governance, and metadata updates.

> **Fund the operator address with at least 2 SUI.** At startup the node moves 1 SUI into the account's address balance (used to pay gas for parallel transactions), so exactly 1 SUI cannot cover that bootstrap plus its own gas and the node fails with `InsufficientCoinBalance`.

All three simple Sui key schemes (Ed25519, secp256k1, and secp256r1) are accepted, in any of the formats standard tooling produces. The value may be a file path or the key itself inline:

| Format | Produced by |
| --- | --- |
| Bech32 `suiprivkey...` string | `sui keytool generate` / `export` / `convert` |
| Base64 keystore entry | `sui.keystore` entries, `sui keytool convert` |
| PKCS#8 PEM | `openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519` |
| PKCS#8 DER (file path only) | `openssl genpkey ... -outform DER` |

```bash
# Option A: sui keytool (writes <address>.key to the current directory)
sui keytool generate ed25519

# Option B: openssl
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out hashi-operator-key.pem
```

```toml
operator-private-key = "/path/to/hashi-operator-key.pem"
# or inline, e.g.:
# operator-private-key = "suiprivkey1..."
```

**Finding the operator address.** You need the key's Sui address to fund it and to pass as `--operator-address`. With `sui keytool generate` the address is printed at generation (and is the name of the `.key` file it writes). For an existing openssl PEM, derive it from the public key (Ed25519 keys only; `0x00` is the Ed25519 scheme flag):

```bash
openssl pkey -in hashi-operator-key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | \
  python3 -c "import sys,hashlib; print('0x' + hashlib.blake2b(b'\x00' + sys.stdin.buffer.read(), digest_size=32).hexdigest())"
```

> A raw hex private key (the `hexWithoutFlag` output of `sui keytool convert`) is **not** accepted, because it does not carry the key-scheme flag. Convert it to one of the formats above with `sui keytool convert`.

**Delegating to the operator key.** Delegation is set with `--operator-address`, normally passed during initial registration as shown in [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key), so one transaction registers **and** delegates. If you registered without it (or are rotating the operator key), run the same command again; it is idempotent and sends only the missing updates, but the transaction must again be signed by the validator account key:

```bash
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only
# sign with the validator account key (cold/hardware) and broadcast
```

Onchain, every member action is authorized by `member_authorized(validator, sender)`, where the sender must be the member's validator key **or** its registered operator address. So once delegated, the operator key performs cert submission, governance voting, and metadata updates on its own, and **the validator account key can return to cold storage**. You need it again only to rotate the operator key or change registration metadata.

Metadata maintenance is automatic once delegated: at startup the node compares its config against the onchain member record and sends only what changed. To update your endpoint URL, TLS key, or other metadata, edit the config file and restart the node; no manual `hashi register` re-run is needed.

**Operator-key rotation is validator-only.** Only the validator account key can change the operator address (onchain, `set_operator_address` requires the sender to be the validator). A compromised or lost operator key therefore cannot re-delegate or lock you out: pull the validator key from cold storage, run `hashi register --operator-address 0x<new-operator> --print-only`, sign offline, and this action revokes the previous operator key.

> **Break-glass / backup.** Because the validator key always retains full authority, it doubles as a recovery key. If the operator key is unavailable, the validator key can perform any member action directly, such as signing the node's transactions or voting.

### 2.5 Backup key (OpenPGP)

Hashi creates encrypted backups of critical state (MPC key shares, DB, config) every epoch. Encryption needs only the **public** OpenPGP certificate, so the private key never has to be on the server during normal operation.

- **Option 1 (recommended): YubiKey.** Generate the key on the device; the private key never leaves it.
- **Option 2: local OpenPGP key.** Generate with `sq` or `gpg`.

Set the armored public certificate (a file path or inline armored text) in the node config:

```toml
backup-pgp-cert = "/path/to/hashi-backup-cert.asc"   # armored OpenPGP public cert, or inline armored text
backup-dir = "/var/lib/hashi/backups"
```

Key generation and restore are covered in the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide. Store the private key / YubiKey securely and separately from the backup files.

---

## 3. Configuration

Hashi uses two configuration files:

1. **Validator config**, used by `hashi server` and `hashi register`. Contains keys, endpoints, and all node parameters.
2. **CLI config** (`hashi-cli.toml`), used by governance, query, and deposit/withdraw commands.

### 3.1 Validator config

All fields use kebab-case. Optional fields show their defaults in comments.

> **Field order matters.** In TOML, every key that appears after a `[section]` header belongs to that section. Keep all top-level keys **above** the `[hashi-ids]` and `[bitcoin-rpc-auth]` sections (as in the template below); a top-level key placed after a section header is rejected at startup with an unknown-field error.

```toml

### 3.2 CLI config

For governance commands, queries, and user-facing operations. Generate a template:

```bash
hashi config template -o hashi-cli.toml
```

```toml
# Sui gRPC endpoint
sui_rpc_url = "https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443"

# Hashi package ID (original package address)
package_id = "0x<package-id>"

# Hashi shared object ID
hashi_object_id = "0x<hashi-object-id>"

# Path to the keypair for signing CLI transactions, in any format
# listed in section 2.4
keypair_path = "/path/to/operator-key.pem"

[bitcoin]
rpc_url = "http://127.0.0.1:38332"
rpc_user = "YOUR_RPC_USER"
rpc_password = "YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD"
network = "signet"
```

### 3.3 Environment variables

All environment variables override their corresponding config file values.

| Variable | Overrides | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `HASHI_CLI_CONFIG` | n/a | Path to CLI config file |
| `SUI_RPC_URL` | `sui_rpc_url` / `sui-rpc` | Sui gRPC endpoint |

## 4. Network and firewall

### 4.1 Inbound

| Port | Protocol | Source | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **443** (default) | TLS 1.3 + gRPC | Other committee validators | MPC protocol messages, DKG, signing, deposit/withdrawal coordination |

The port is configurable through `listen-address`. It must be publicly reachable at the URL specified in `endpoint-url`, which is registered onchain.

### 4.2 Outbound

| Destination | Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|
| Sui fullnode | 443 (public) / 9000 (self-hosted) | gRPC over HTTP/2 | Chain state, checkpoint subscription, tx submission |
| Bitcoin RPC | per network (38332 on Signet) | HTTP/JSON-RPC | Tx lookup, fee estimation, UTXO checks, **withdrawal broadcast** |
| Bitcoin P2P | per network (38333 on Signet) | TCP | Kyoto BIP-157 light client (headers, filters, blocks) |
| Peer validators | 443 | TLS 1.3 + gRPC | Outbound connections to other committee members |

> - **Sui:** the connection is HTTP/2 gRPC. HTTP/1.1-only proxies (or anything that strips HTTP/2) break the checkpoint subscription.
> - **Bitcoin RPC:** the node broadcasts withdrawals through `sendrawtransaction`, so the RPC user/whitelist must permit it, not only read calls.

### 4.3 Metrics (localhost only)

| Port | Protocol | Bind | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| **9180** (default) | HTTP | 127.0.0.1 | Prometheus scrape endpoint at `/metrics` |

Not exposed externally by default. Scrape from localhost or through a reverse proxy with access controls.

### 4.4 TLS

- Hashi uses **TLS 1.3 exclusively** with Ed25519 self-signed certificates.
- The TLS public key is registered onchain, so peers verify certificates against the onchain registry, with no certificate authority requirement.
- The node auto-generates certificates from the `tls-private-key` at startup.

---

## 5. Genesis procedure

Genesis forms the initial Hashi committee and generates the shared Bitcoin master key through Distributed Key Generation (DKG).

### 5.1 Timeline

```
Package Published → Validators Register → Launch (Admin) → DKG (Automatic) → End Reconfig → Presignatures → Operational
```

From DKG trigger to operational typically takes 30 to 120 seconds, assuming validators are online and reachable.

### 5.2 Step 1: package publication (admin)

The admin publishes the Hashi Move package. This produces the `package-id` and `hashi-object-id` you need in both configs; the values for each network are recorded in the [Networks](#networks) table.

At this point the deploy is **not yet configured**: the package `UpgradeCap` stays in the publisher's wallet, and the chain id and guardian parameters are not onchain yet. They land later with the launch step (`hashi::finish_publish`), the **launch switch** that unlocks genesis.

### 5.3 Step 2: register your validator

Registration must be authorized by your **Sui validator account key** (see [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key)). Use the offline flow:

```bash
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only
# sign the printed base64 tx with the account key and broadcast; see 2.3 for
# the sui keytool sign / sui client execute-signed-tx commands
```

The registration transaction writes your BLS12-381 public key, Ed25519 TLS public key, ECIES encryption public key, endpoint URL, and operator address to the chain.

### 5.4 Step 3: start the server

```bash
hashi server --config /path/to/validator.toml
```

The node starts the gRPC+TLS server, connects to Sui (gRPC) and Bitcoin (RPC + P2P), registers its next-epoch keys onchain, and begins monitoring for the genesis trigger.

Booting **before the launch step is expected and required** because the launch only happens once every validator has finished key registration, which nodes do on startup. In this pre-launch window the onchain config is not finalized yet, so the node logs two benign warnings: the `bitcoin_chain_id` cross-check is skipped (it re-verifies on any restart after launch), and the guardian client is deferred (it resolves automatically from onchain config once the launch lands).

**This is the last genesis step performed by operators.** Steps 4 through 6 are handled by the admin and the network; keep your node running and watch the logs.

### 5.5 Step 4: launch (admin)

Genesis is gated on an explicit launch step. Once every expected validator has registered and started its node, the publisher runs:

```bash
hashi launch \
  --bitcoin-chain-id <genesis block hash> \
  --guardian-url <guardian gRPC URL> \
  --guardian-btc-public-key <x-only hex> \
  --keypair /path/to/publisher.pem   # reads ./hashi_ids.json from publish
```

This sends `hashi::finish_publish`: it finalizes the deploy configuration (chain id, guardian) and hands the package `UpgradeCap` into onchain custody, the launch switch that `start_reconfig` requires before it forms the initial committee. Before sending, the command lists the registered validators and flags any that have not finished key registration (the genesis committee would exclude them). The **initial committee is exactly the set of fully-registered validators at this moment**, so the admin should confirm the roster before launching. Multisig publishers can use `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` (with `--sender`) to produce the transaction for offline signing. Automation can poll `hashi launch --status` (no keypair or guardian parameters needed) for a single machine-readable readiness line instead of parsing the human output.

**No operator action needed**, but your validator must be registered and running before the admin launches; otherwise it is excluded from the genesis committee.

### 5.6 Step 5: DKG (automatic)

Once the launch transaction lands, the first node to detect it submits `start_reconfig`. All registered validators then run DKG concurrently. **No operator action needed**; monitor logs for `start_reconfig`, `DKG started`, `DKG completed`. DKG times out after 600 s per attempt and retries until it succeeds or a newer epoch supersedes it.

### 5.7 Step 6: end reconfig (automatic)

After DKG, validators exchange BLS signatures over the result. Once 2/3 of committee weight has signed, `end_reconfig` is submitted onchain and the committee generates presignatures. **No operator action needed**; monitor logs for `end_reconfig submitted` and presignature generation.

### 5.8 Post-genesis verification

```bash
hashi committee list
hashi committee epoch
hashi committee view 0x<your-validator-address>
hashi config on-chain

curl -s http://localhost:9180/metrics | grep -E 'hashi_epoch|hashi_reconfig_in_progress|hashi_presig_pool_remaining'
```

Expected after success: `hashi_epoch` > 0, `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` = 0, `hashi_presig_pool_remaining` > 0.

---

## 6. CLI reference

### 6.1 Global options

```
--config, -c          CLI config file path          (env: HASHI_CLI_CONFIG)
--sui-rpc-url         Sui gRPC endpoint             (env: SUI_RPC_URL)
--package-id          Hashi package ID              (env: HASHI_PACKAGE_ID)
--hashi-object-id     Hashi shared object ID        (env: HASHI_OBJECT_ID)
--keypair, -k         Signing keypair path          (env: HASHI_KEYPAIR)
--verbose, -v         Enable verbose output
--yes, -y             Skip confirmation prompts
--gas-budget          Gas budget in MIST            (env: HASHI_GAS_BUDGET)
--dry-run             Simulate without executing
```

### 6.2 Server

```bash
hashi server [--config <path>]
```

Run the Hashi validator daemon. Uses the validator config.

### 6.3 Register

```bash
hashi register --config <path> [--operator-address <addr>] [--print-only] [-v] [-y]
```

Register or update your validator onchain. Initial registration must be signed by the validator account key; use `--print-only` for offline signing. Idempotent.

### 6.4 Committee

```bash
hashi committee list [--epoch <N>]     # List committee members (default: current epoch)
hashi committee view <address>         # View details for a specific validator
hashi committee epoch                  # Show current epoch info
```

### 6.5 Config

```bash
hashi config template [-o <path>]      # Generate CLI config template (default: hashi-cli.toml)
hashi config show                      # Show effective CLI configuration
hashi config on-chain                  # View on-chain protocol configuration
```

### 6.6 Proposals (governance)

```bash
hashi proposal list [--type <type>] [--detailed]
hashi proposal view <proposal-id>
hashi proposal vote <proposal-id> [--execute]
hashi proposal remove-vote <proposal-id>
hashi proposal execute <proposal-id>
```

Create proposals:

```bash
hashi proposal create update-config <key> <value> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create update-mpc-config [--threshold-bps <N>] [--max-faulty-bps <N>] [--weight-reduction-allowed-delta <N>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create upgrade [--package-path <path> | --digest <hex>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create enable-version <version> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create disable-version <version> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create abort-reconfig [--epoch <N>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create update-guardian [--url <url>] [--public-key <hex>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create emergency-pause [--unpause] [-m key=value]
```

Config values are type-prefixed: `u64:30000`, `bool:true`.

### 6.7 Backup

Backups are **OpenPGP (Sequoia)**: encrypted archives use the suffix `.tar.asc`; unencrypted archives use `.tar` (format auto-detected on restore).

```bash
# Create a backup (cert taken from the node config's backup-pgp-cert, or override inline/by path)
hashi backup save <node-config-path> [--backup-pgp-cert <armored-cert-or-path>] [--output-dir .]

# Restore an encrypted .tar.asc — exactly one decryptor is required:
hashi backup restore <tarball> --backup-pgp-secret-key <secret-key-file> [--output-dir .] [--copy-to-original-paths]
hashi backup restore <tarball> --use-gpg-agent [--gpg-homedir <dir>] [--output-dir .] [--copy-to-original-paths]

# Restore an unencrypted .tar — no key needed
hashi backup restore <tarball.tar> [--output-dir .]
```

`--use-gpg-agent` supports YubiKeys, including over a forwarded `gpg-agent` socket. `--copy-to-original-paths` writes files back to the absolute paths captured at backup time (same-host in-place recovery only).

### 6.8 Deposit, withdraw, and balance

```bash
# Deposits
hashi deposit generate-address --recipient <sui-address>
hashi deposit request --txid <btc-txid> [--outputs <json>] [--recipient <sui-addr>]
hashi deposit request-single --txid <btc-txid> --vout <n> --amount <sats> [--recipient <sui-addr>]
hashi deposit status <request-id>
hashi deposit list [--json]

# Withdrawals
hashi withdraw request --amount <sats> --btc-address <addr> [--count <N>]   # --count submits N identical requests (default 1)
hashi withdraw cancel <request-id>
hashi withdraw status <request-id>
hashi withdraw list [--json]

# Balance
hashi balance <sui-address> [--json]
```

These are primarily for testing or admin use, not routine operator tasks.

### 6.9 Publish (admin only)

```bash
hashi publish ...
```

Builds, publishes, and initializes the Hashi Move package (including its onchain protocol and custody configuration). The admin runs this, not individual operators.

## 7. Governance participation

### 7.1 How proposals work

- Any committee member can create a proposal. Quorum is stake-weighted: most proposals require **2/3 of committee weight**, while an emergency pause uses a lower threshold (5%) so the committee can halt the protocol quickly (resuming again requires 2/3). See the threshold column in [7.2](#72-proposal-types).
- Votes can be added/removed before execution. Once quorum is reached, any committee member can execute.
- The `--execute` flag on `vote` auto-executes if your vote reaches quorum (except for Upgrade proposals).
- Proposals carry optional `-m key=value` metadata for human context.

> Governance actions are authorized by [member](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing): the signer must be the committee member's validator key **or** its delegated operator key, and the system records the vote under the validator for stake-weight purposes. So your operator key can vote on the validator's behalf.

### 7.2 Proposal types

| Type | Threshold | Purpose | Parameters |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **UpdateConfig** | 2/3 | Change protocol parameters | `key` and type-prefixed `value` |
| **UpdateMpcConfig** | 2/3 | Change MPC threshold/faulty/delta | `--threshold-bps`, `--max-faulty-bps`, `--weight-reduction-allowed-delta` |
| **Upgrade** | 2/3 | Publish a new package version | `--package-path` or `--digest` |
| **EnableVersion** | 2/3 | Re-enable a disabled package version | `version` number |
| **DisableVersion** | 2/3 | Disable a package version | `version` number (cannot disable active version) |
| **AbortReconfig** | 2/3 | Abort a stuck reconfiguration | `--epoch` of pending reconfig |
| **UpdateGuardian** | 2/3 | Change guardian endpoint and key | `--url`, `--public-key` |
| **EmergencyPause** | 5% to pause, 2/3 to unpause | Quickly pause or resume the protocol in an emergency | n/a |

> EmergencyPause uses a deliberately low threshold so a small fraction of committee weight can halt the protocol fast; resuming requires the normal 2/3. Create it with `hashi proposal create emergency-pause` (add `--unpause` to propose resuming).

**Configurable protocol parameters:**

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `bitcoin_deposit_minimum` | u64 | 30,000 sats | Minimum deposit amount (floor: 546 sats) |
| `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum` | u64 | 30,000 sats | Minimum withdrawal amount (floor: 547 sats) |
| `bitcoin_confirmation_threshold` | u64 | 6 blocks | Confirmations required before the deposit becomes final |
| `bitcoin_deposit_time_delay_ms` | u64 | **600,000 ms (10 min)** | Delay between deposit approval and confirmation (fraud window) |
| `withdrawal_cancellation_cooldown_ms` | u64 | 3,600,000 ms (1 hr) | Cooldown before a withdrawal can be cancelled |
| `paused` | bool | false | Pause all deposit/withdrawal processing |

> The CLI `update-config --help` lists a subset of keys (`bitcoin_deposit_minimum`, `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum`, `bitcoin_confirmation_threshold`, `withdrawal_cancellation_cooldown_ms`, `paused`); `bitcoin_deposit_time_delay_ms` is still settable.

### 7.3 Lifecycle example: UpdateConfig

```bash
# 1. Create the proposal
hashi proposal create update-config bitcoin_deposit_minimum u64:50000 \
  -m reason="Increase minimum to reduce small-value UTXO accumulation"
# note the proposal ID: 0x<proposal-id>

# 2. Share the proposal ID with other committee members

# 3. Vote (--execute auto-executes if quorum is reached)
hashi proposal vote 0x<proposal-id> --execute

# 4. Check status
hashi proposal view 0x<proposal-id>

# 5. Execute manually if needed
hashi proposal execute 0x<proposal-id>

# 6. Verify
hashi config on-chain
```

### 7.4 Package upgrade flow

```bash
# Build and propose (CLI verifies PACKAGE_VERSION is incremented)
hashi proposal create upgrade --package-path /path/to/packages/hashi

# Vote (--execute is NOT supported for Upgrade proposals)
hashi proposal vote 0x<proposal-id>

# After quorum: execute the upgrade
hashi proposal execute 0x<proposal-id>
```

---

## 8. Monitoring and metrics

### 8.1 Prometheus endpoint

Metrics are served at `http://127.0.0.1:9180/metrics` (configurable through `metrics-http-address`).

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9180/metrics | grep hashi_
```

### 8.2 Metrics push

Configure the node to push its metrics to the Mysten-operated collection endpoint. The Hashi team relies on this for fleet-wide visibility during Testnet, so every operator must include this section in the validator config:

```toml
[metrics-push]
push-url = "https://metrics-proxy.testnet.sui.io:8443/publish/metrics"
# How often to push (default: 60)
# push-interval-seconds = 60
```

Notes:

- `[metrics-push]` is a TOML table: keep it at the **end** of the config file with the other sections, per the field-order note in [3.1](#31-validator-config).
- **No extra credentials are needed.** The push authenticates with your existing `tls-private-key` as a TLS client identity, verified against the TLS public key you registered onchain. It therefore only works after your registration is complete.
- The node does not fail without this section; it silently starts without the push task. Check your config if the team reports not seeing your metrics.

### 8.3 Key metrics

| Metric | Type | What to Watch |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `uptime` | gauge | Node uptime (s). Labels: `version`, `sui_chain_id`, `bitcoin_chain_id`, `package_id`. |
| `hashi_epoch` | gauge | Current Hashi epoch. Should advance with Sui epochs. |
| `hashi_sui_epoch` | gauge | Current Sui epoch. |
| `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` | gauge | 1 during reconfiguration. Extended periods = problem. |
| `hashi_paused` | gauge | 1 when deposits/withdrawals are paused. |
| `hashi_presig_pool_remaining` | gauge | Presignatures available. Should not reach 0. |
| `hashi_is_leader` | gauge | 1 when this node is the current leader. |
| `hashi_kyoto_synced` | gauge | 1 when the Bitcoin light client is synced. |
| `hashi_kyoto_best_height` | gauge | Bitcoin tip block height. |
| `hashi_kyoto_connected_peers` | gauge | Bitcoin P2P peer count. |
| `hashi_deposit_queue_size` | gauge | Pending deposit requests. |
| `hashi_withdrawal_queue_size` | gauge | Pending withdrawals (by status). |
| `hashi_utxo_pool_size` | gauge | Managed UTXOs (available / unconfirmed_change / locked). |
| `hashi_mpc_sign_failures_total` | counter | MPC signing failures. Investigate if increasing. |
| `hashi_mpc_reconfig_total_duration_seconds` | histogram | DKG/rotation duration. |
| `hashi_sui_tx_submissions_total` | counter | Sui tx submissions (by operation, status). |
| `hashi_sui_balance` | gauge | Operator gas wallet SUI balance in MIST (owned coins + address balance). `-1` until the first successful sample. |
| `hashi_leader_retries_total` | counter | Leader operation retries (by operation, error kind). |

### 8.4 Suggested alerts

| Condition | Severity | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `hashi_reconfig_in_progress == 1` for > 10 min | Critical | Check logs for DKG/rotation errors. Might need `AbortReconfig`. |
| `hashi_presig_pool_remaining == 0` | Critical | Node cannot sign. Check reconfig status and MPC logs. |
| `hashi_kyoto_synced == 0` for > 5 min | Warning | Light client lost sync. Check Bitcoin RPC and P2P connectivity. |
| `hashi_kyoto_connected_peers == 0` | Warning | No Bitcoin P2P peers. Check `bitcoin-trusted-peers` and reachability. |
| `hashi_mpc_sign_failures_total` increasing | Warning | Investigate MPC protocol errors in logs. |
| `hashi_sui_balance < 1e9 and hashi_sui_balance >= 0` (below 1 SUI) | Warning | Gas wallet running low; the node stops landing Sui transactions when it empties. Top up the operator address. (`-1` means not yet sampled, not empty.) |
| `up == 0` (Prometheus target down) | Critical | Node is down. Restart and check logs. |

> **Coming soon:** A metrics **push** service for centralized collection. Details follow once it lands.

## 9. Epoch changes (reconfiguration)

### 9.1 What happens automatically

On every Sui epoch change, the Hashi committee reconfigures:

1. A node detects the Sui epoch change and submits `start_reconfig`.
2. The system pauses deposit and withdrawal processing.
3. **Key rotation** runs. The old committee redistributes key shares to the new committee (the Bitcoin master public key is unchanged). The genesis epoch runs DKG instead.
4. Validators exchange BLS signatures; once 2/3 weight signs, `end_reconfig` is submitted.
5. The new committee generates presignatures.
6. Normal operations resume.

### 9.2 Operator responsibilities

- **Keep your node online across epoch boundaries.** It must participate in key rotation.
- **Keep registration metadata current.** If you change endpoint URL, TLS key, or other registration info, re-run `hashi register` before the next epoch change. Metadata updates accept either the operator or the validator key.
- **Monitor reconfiguration.** Watch `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` and `hashi_mpc_reconfig_total_duration_seconds`.

### 9.3 Stuck reconfigurations

If reconfiguration stalls (offline validators, misconfigured endpoints, protocol failures), the committee can abort and retry:

```bash
hashi proposal create abort-reconfig --epoch <pending-epoch>
hashi proposal vote 0x<proposal-id> --execute
```

After execution, the previous committee resumes; the system can trigger a new reconfiguration on the next Sui epoch boundary. Common causes: too much registered stake offline/unreachable, invalid endpoints or stale TLS keys, network partitions preventing MPC message exchange.

---

## 10. Backup and restore

The full key-generation and restore procedures (including YubiKey setup with `oct` and decrypting over SSH) are in the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide. This section is a quick summary.

When `backup-pgp-cert` is configured, the node automatically writes an encrypted backup every epoch: it packs the DB (MPC key shares, signing/encryption keys), config, and referenced key files into a tar archive and wraps it as an ASCII-armored OpenPGP (Sequoia) message. Encrypted archives use the suffix `.tar.asc`; unencrypted archives use `.tar`. The node writes backups to `backup-dir` (default `/tmp`, so set a persistent path). Encryption needs only the public certificate, so the private key need not be present during normal operation.

Because backups use OpenPGP, you can restore over SSH: plug the YubiKey into your laptop, forward your `gpg-agent` to the server, and decrypt the backup there. The private key never leaves the YubiKey.

```bash
# Manual backup
hashi backup save /path/to/validator.toml \
  --backup-pgp-cert /path/to/hashi-backup-cert.asc \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/backups

# Restore with a local OpenPGP secret key
hashi backup restore /var/lib/hashi/backups/hashi-backup-*.tar.asc \
  --backup-pgp-secret-key /path/to/secret-key.asc \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/restore

# Restore via gpg-agent / YubiKey (works over a forwarded agent)
hashi backup restore /var/lib/hashi/backups/hashi-backup-*.tar.asc \
  --use-gpg-agent [--gpg-homedir /path/to/gnupghome] \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/restore
```

---

## 11. Coming soon

The following capabilities are planned but not yet available.

### Screener setup

> **Coming soon:** Guidance on AML/sanctions screening. The `screener-endpoint` config field points to a gRPC screener service; when unset, screening is skipped. Setup instructions to follow.

### Metrics push service

> **Coming soon:** A centralized metrics push service, to push Prometheus metrics to a shared endpoint for aggregate monitoring.

### Cloud backup integration

> **Coming soon:** Support for automatically uploading encrypted backups to cloud storage (for example, S3).

---

## 12. Publishing a release (Mysten)

This section is for **Mysten release engineers**; operators can ignore it. A release is cut at a commit sha on `main` and ships on two channels: the container image (Artifact Registry for Mysten-managed deploys, Docker Hub for everyone else) and the deterministic binary (§1.3).

### 12.1 Container image

Dispatch `hashi-build-image.yml` in sui-operations at the release commit:

```bash
gh workflow run hashi-build-image.yml -R MystenLabs/sui-operations --ref main \
  -f hashi_commit=<sha> \
  -f push_to_dockerhub=true
```

A single run builds the image once and pushes both `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cryptic-bolt-398315/hashi/hashi:<sha>` and the public `mysten/hashi:<sha>`, and drops the raw binary at `https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-hashi-binaries/<sha>/hashi` (public). Artifact Registry rejects anonymous pulls — Docker Hub is the operator-facing channel; bare-metal operators use the deterministic binary (§12.2), and the GCS drop is internal. Confirm the tag is live:

```bash
curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/mysten/hashi/tags/<sha> | jq -r .digest
```

### 12.2 Deterministic binary

Dispatch `deterministic-build.yml` in this repo at the same commit; it builds `out/hashi` on two runner generations and fails on any hash mismatch. Publish the artifacts under the sui-releases convention:

```bash
gh workflow run deterministic-build.yml -R MystenLabs/hashi --ref main
gh run download <run-id> -R MystenLabs/hashi \
  -n hashi-ubuntu-latest-binary -n hashi-ubuntu-latest-sha256
aws s3 cp hashi-ubuntu-latest-binary/hashi        s3://sui-releases/<sha>/hashi
aws s3 cp hashi-ubuntu-latest-sha256/hashi.sha256 s3://sui-releases/<sha>/hashi.sha256
```

Operators download from `https://sui-releases.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<sha>/hashi` and can reproduce the checksum themselves (§1.3).

### 12.3 Rolling the Mysten testnet nodes

The six Mysten validators (`mysten1`–`mysten6`) are single-replica Deployments in namespace `hashi-testnet` on `workloads-secondary-use4`, managed by the `mysten/testnet` stack of `pulumi/services/hashi-server` in sui-operations. Each mounts a ReadWriteOnce PVC, which is why the Deployments use the `Recreate` strategy — never switch them back to `RollingUpdate`; a surge pod would double-mount the DB volume.

Set `hashi-server:image.image_ref` to the release sha in `pulumi/services/hashi-server/Pulumi.testnet.yaml` (land it as a PR), then roll **one node at a time**:

```bash
cd pulumi/services/hashi-server && pulumi stack select mysten/testnet

# For each N in 1..6, in order:
pulumi up --yes --target "urn:pulumi:testnet::hashi-server::kubernetes:apps/v1:Deployment::mysten<N>"
kubectl -n hashi-testnet rollout status deploy/mysten<N> --timeout=600s
kubectl -n hashi-testnet logs deploy/mysten<N> | grep -m1 "Guardian bootstrap complete"
```

Proceed to the next node only after all three checks pass. If a node does not come back healthy, stop and investigate before touching the next — every additional node down eats into the committee's 2/3 signing margin (§9).

Rollout gotchas:

- **Serialize the updates.** Wait for each `pulumi up` to exit before starting the next; concurrent targeted ups conflict on the stack lock (409).
- **Don't trust the pod label for readiness.** `kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l hashi-node=mysten<N>` also matches the still-terminating old pod.
- **Unhealthy fleet, different gates.** Mid-incident (for example a reconfiguration stall, §9.3) no pod turns Ready, so `rollout status` never completes and pulumi's readiness await reports the Deployment as errored even though the image update applied. Gate on the pod reaching `Running` with no restarts plus the guardian bootstrap log line, and re-run the targeted `pulumi up` after recovery to reconcile state.
