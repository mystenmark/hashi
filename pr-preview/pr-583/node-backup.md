> How node operators encrypt and back up their essential data with age, with optional YubiKey-based key generation.

To prevent a node from being unable to rejoin the Hashi committee in the event
of data loss, Hashi implements an automatic backup system. Every epoch, the key
information needed to restore a node, including db data and config files, is
saved to a compressed and encrypted file. You can restore a backup file through
the hashi cli.

## Creating an `age` private key

For security reasons, we must encrypt the backups. Our backup procedure uses
[`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age).

### Option 1: Create a private key on a YubiKey (recommended)

The recommended procedure is to generate an `age` private key entirely on
a YubiKey and encrypt the key share with it. This makes it practically
impossible for anyone to decrypt the backup without physical access to the
YubiKey. The risk is that you will also be unable to decrypt the backup if
you lose access to the YubiKey. To minimize this risk, obtain at least two
YubiKeys and repeat the procedure for each.

For the initial YubiKey setup, you must use a machine with a physical USB
port. After initial setup, you can encrypt the share to the public key of
the YubiKey on any machine, including a cloud server without a USB port.

1. Obtain a new [YubiKey 5 Series](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/).
   There are six models: the YubiKey 5C NFC, 5 NFC, 5C, 5 Nano, 5C Nano, and
   5CI. Any of these models works, though avoid the Nano models because they
   are smaller and easier to lose.

2. Install the required packages:
    - The [`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) or
      [`rage`](https://github.com/str4d/rage) package. Either works. `rage`
      is an implementation of `age` in Rust. Both are widely available in
      package repositories, and `rage` can also be installed with
      `cargo install`. Install on both the machine with USB access and the
      machine containing the key share.
    - The [`age-plugin-yubikey`](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey)
      package. This is also available on various package repositories, and
      can also be installed with `cargo install`. Install only on the
      machine with USB access.

3. Generate an `age` private key on the YubiKey:
    - On the machine with physical USB access, insert the YubiKey into the
      machine's USB port. Ensure no other YubiKeys or smart cards are
      plugged into the machine.
    - Run `age-plugin-yubikey`. This starts the generation process.
    - Select the YubiKey you plugged in.
    - Select slot 1 for the new private key.
    - Accept the default identity name by pressing **Enter**.
    - Select the default Once PIN policy by pressing **Enter**.
    - Select the default Always touch policy by pressing **Enter**.
    - Press **y** to confirm generating the identity.
    - Enter the current YubiKey PIN, which is the default `123456`.
    - The setup prompts you to change the default PIN. Enter the current
      PUK (PIN unblocking key, or admin PIN), which is the default
      `12345678`.
    - Enter a new PIN for the YubiKey. It can contain numbers, letters,
      and symbols, and must be 6, 7, or 8 characters long. This PIN is
      essential. If you lose it, you cannot decrypt the key share backup.
      Back up this PIN in a safe place, such as a company password
      manager. Do not use the default PIN. The value you enter is set for
      both the PIN and the PUK.
    - Touch the button on the YubiKey to allow certificate generation.
    - Select the default identity filename by pressing **Enter**. This
      identity file contains the public key for the private key you
      generated on the YubiKey, and information telling `age` how to use
      the private key on the YubiKey. It does not contain the private key.

4. Test encryption and decryption:
    - Obtain your recipient by running `cat <identity-file-name>.txt`. You
      see a value like
      `age1yubikey1qwyxmxdzmw2fgfxv8na6g9xwsqcgn7vcjjte5qp9ehhse9gwpdd8zaejcc8`.
      Save this value.
    - Create a test text file. The contents can be anything. For example,
      run `echo "Testing, 1, 2, 3..." > test.txt`.
    - Encrypt the test file by running this command:
      `age --recipient <recipient> --armor --output test.txt.age test.txt`.
    - Run this command to decrypt:
      `age --decrypt --identity <identify file path> hashi-key-share.age`.
    - Enter your PIN.
    - Tap the YubiKey to confirm.
    - Confirm that the output matches the original test file.

5. Store the YubiKeys in a secure location, such as a company safe. Also
   save the identity file in a secure location.

### Option 2: Create a local private key file

If you do not want to use a YubiKey, you can generate an `age` private key
locally and encrypt with it. Because the private key is stored in a normal
file instead of on a YubiKey, there is a greater risk of unauthorized use
of the private key. Store the file carefully.

1. Install the required packages:
    - The [`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) or
      [`rage`](https://github.com/str4d/rage) package. Either works. `rage`
      is an implementation of `age` in Rust. Both are widely available in
      package repositories, and `rage` can also be installed with
      `cargo install`.

2. Generate a new key pair:
    - Run the following command to generate a new public-private key pair
      and save it to a file:
      `age-keygen --output hashi-backup-secret-key.txt`.

3. Test encryption and decryption:
    - The recipient public key is printed by the previous command, looking
      something like
      `age1zeq3ve2rrz6qdccshxzny0jf7sd0r5qdfrakw0u9fps40svauy6s746j58`.
      Save this value.
    - Create a test text file. The contents can be anything. For example,
      run `echo "Testing, 1, 2, 3..." > test.txt`.
    - Encrypt the test file by running this command:
      `age --recipient <recipient> --armor --output test.txt.age test.txt`.
    - Run this command to decrypt:
      `age --decrypt --identity hashi-backup-secret-key.txt test.txt.age`.
    - Confirm that the output matches the key share.

4. Store the private key file in a secure location, such as a company
   password manager or a USB drive in a safe. Do not store the private key
   file in the same location as the encrypted key share backup.

## Configuring hashi

To enable automatic backups using the new age keypair, add the age recipient
to the node config file under the field `backup-age-pubkey`.

You can also configure the location where Hashi saves backups with the field
`backup-dir`.

## Cloud backup

In the future, we will likely add support for automatically uploading backups
to cloud storage such as s3.
