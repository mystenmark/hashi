# Bitcoin Address Scheme

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> Hashi derives a unique Bitcoin Taproot deposit address for every Sui address using a 2-of-2 multisig between the MPC committee and the Guardian.

Every Sui address has its own unique Hashi Bitcoin deposit address. This gives
Hashi a lightweight way to identify which Sui address to credit for a deposit.
All Hashi deposit addresses are `P2TR` (Pay-to-Taproot), where the 2-of-2
multisig script between Hashi and the Guardian is encoded as the sole leaf in
the Taproot tree.

The exact [descriptor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
is:

```
tr({i}, multi_a(2, {g}, {h}))
```

where:

- `H` is the base Hashi MPC public key, available onchain.
- `h = derive(H, d)` is the child public key derived from `H` using
  derivation path `d` (the depositor's Sui address).
- `g` is the guardian's fixed public key.
- `i` is the NUMS (nothing-up-my-sleeve) internal key defined in BIP-341
  (`50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0`)
  with no known private key, ensuring all spends occur through the script path.

The key derivation is not BIP-32. It is a purpose-built unhardened derivation
over secp256k1, keyed by the Sui address, giving each depositor a unique
Bitcoin address while the master signing key remains shared across the MPC
committee.

:::info

On `devnet` the deposit address omits the guardian key and uses a single-key
script path:

```
tr({i}, pk({h}))
```
