# Configuration

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> Onchain configuration parameters that control Hashi's deposit, withdrawal, fee, and operational behavior.

Hashi maintains a set of onchain configuration parameters stored in the
`Config` object. These parameters control protocol behavior for deposits,
withdrawals, fee estimation, and system operations.

You can update all configurable parameters through the `UpdateConfig`
governance proposal, which requires 2/3 of committee weight (see
[Governance Actions](/governance-actions)). Each key is validated against
its expected type on update.

## Parameters

### `bitcoin_deposit_minimum`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `u64` |
| **Default** | `30000` |
| **Unit** | satoshis |
| **Floor** | `546` (dust relay minimum) |

The minimum deposit amount in satoshis. Deposits below this value are rejected
onchain. The effective value is always at least `546 sats` to prevent creating
unspendable UTXOs.

### `bitcoin_deposit_time_delay_ms`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `u64` |
| **Default** | `1000` |
| **Unit** | milliseconds |

The minimum time that must elapse between a deposit being approved by the
committee (`approve_deposit`) and being confirmed (`confirm_deposit`). Provides
a window in which a fraudulent or erroneous approval can be detected and the
service paused before any `hBTC` is minted. See the
[deposit flow](/deposit#confirm) for how this delay fits into the overall
process.

### `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `u64` |
| **Default** | `30000` |
| **Unit** | satoshis |
| **Floor** | `547` (dust relay minimum + 1) |

The minimum total withdrawal amount in satoshis. The `worst_case_network_fee`
is derived as `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum - 546`, which caps the per-user miner
fee deduction. The floor ensures the worst-case network fee is always at least
`1 sat`.

### `bitcoin_confirmation_threshold`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `u64` |
| **Default** | `6` |
| **Unit** | blocks |

The number of Bitcoin block confirmations required before a deposit is
considered final. Guards against chain reorganizations.

### `paused`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `bool` |
| **Default** | `false` |

When `true`, the protocol pauses processing of deposits and withdrawals.
Requests already in the queue remain queued and resume processing when the
system is unpaused. Reconfiguration and governance actions are not affected.

### `withdrawal_cancellation_cooldown_ms`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `u64` |
| **Default** | `3600000` (1 hour) |
| **Unit** | milliseconds |

The minimum time a withdrawal request must remain in the queue before the user
can cancel it. Prevents users from using rapid submit-cancel cycles to
interfere with processing.

## Read-only or genesis-only parameters

### `bitcoin_chain_id`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `address` |

The 32-byte Bitcoin chain identifier as defined by
[BIP-122](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0122.mediawiki)
(the genesis block hash). Set at genesis and not updatable through the
`UpdateConfig` proposal.

## Derived values

Several values are computed from the configurable parameters above rather than
stored directly.

### `deposit_minimum`

```
deposit_minimum = bitcoin_deposit_minimum
```

The minimum deposit amount. With defaults: `30,000 sats`.

### `worst_case_network_fee`

```
worst_case_network_fee = bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum - 546
```

The maximum miner fee the contract accepts for a withdrawal transaction,
derived from `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum` minus the dust threshold. With
defaults: `30,000 - 546 = 29,454 sats`.
