# Governance Actions

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> Proposal types that the Hashi committee uses to upgrade packages, enable or disable versions, and update onchain configuration.

Governance actions are each defined by a unique `Proposal<T>` type. Proposals
adjust protocol parameters, pause or unpause operations, or perform sensitive
operations like package upgrades. Only members of the current Hashi committee
can create proposals. Each proposal type has its own threshold, which a quorum
of validators must reach by voting in support of the proposal.

The following is the current set of available proposal types.

## `Upgrade`

Authorizes a package upgrade.

## `EnableVersion`

Re-enables a previously disabled package version, allowing the protocol to use
it again.

## `DisableVersion`

Disables a package version, preventing it from being used. The currently
active version cannot be disabled, to avoid bricking the protocol.

## `UpdateConfig`

Updates a protocol configuration parameter by key. Supports any config
key-value pair (for example, deposit fee, rate limits).
