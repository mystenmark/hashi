# hashi-guardian

Guardian enclave service that emits immutable S3 logs for audit/state-restart workflows.

The S3 bucket operator is untrusted. Log signatures bind the intent, schema
version, session ID, timestamp, intended object key, and event. Readers compare
the signed key in JSON with the actual S3 key and reject relocated or
non-canonical records. Random failure suffixes are sampled once before signing.
Unsigned OI attestations bind placement through their Nitro-authenticated
signing key and derived session ID.

Guardians emit and read a single log schema, with `schema_version: 1` reset
for the testnet wipe. Pre-wipe records are no longer supported. KP-share records
carry one recipient fingerprint and one ciphertext per share. The
`VersionedLogMessage` wrapper retains explicit version dispatch for future
schema changes.

## Initialization and build identity

The EIF contains no bucket, region, mode, or Git revision label. A fresh enclave
reports no lifecycle or deployment summary until operator initialization.
Operator tooling verifies its attestation and approved PCR before sending
`OperatorInit`. The request chooses ceremony or withdraw mode and supplies the
shared `DeploymentConfig` plus separate S3 credentials. Its current-build
allowlist entry supplies the revision label; there is no separate revision input.

Initialization checks its own PCR against the proposed current build, validates
S3 connectivity, and prepares the mode-specific state,
then writes the attestation and signed, operator-initialized GuardianInfo logs.
Only after those logs are durable does the live lifecycle advance. Mode and the full deployment configuration are fixed for that session. Heartbeats remain idle until
withdraw initialization completes. Tooling verifies the same session and expected
configuration afterward. A revision label is only a lookup key into an
independently approved revision-to-PCR mapping; it never proves the source by
itself. Both modes use the same image and revision label, without a `-ceremony`
suffix.

The enclave S3 client resolves its configured S3 names to the three existing
loopback/VSOCK forwarders. HTTPS still authenticates the real S3 hostnames. The
parent's forwarding destinations must match the operator-supplied bucket/region;
parent user-data remains deployment-specific. Host-side tools and local dev
clients use their existing networking.

These lifecycle, signing, and OI-log changes require the coordinated testnet wipe
and matching new enclave/tooling deployment. Pre-wipe OI records are not supported.

## Heartbeat write fencing

Every Guardian S3 log write is serialized. After the first successful
withdraw-mode heartbeat, the writer allows another attempt only when its full
timeout fits before the latest successful heartbeat plus the reader's quiet
period minus the clock-skew budget. Successful non-heartbeat writes do not
extend that deadline.

The writer captures a monotonic timestamp immediately before constructing the
signed heartbeat record and renews its local deadline only after S3 confirms
the write. Readers independently apply the same quiet period to the heartbeat's
signed wall-clock timestamp. The fencing argument makes these assumptions:

- **Assumption 1: clock skew does not make the activating reader's quiet-period
  boundary occur before the writer's fence.**
  - **What it is:** The clocks need not be identical. The safety requirement is
    that the reader must not declare the prior session quiet while the writer is
    still allowed to make a write. The writer places its fence
    `ACTIVATING_READER_CLOCK_SKEW_BUDGET` before the reader's quiet-period
    boundary. Reader-ahead skew and any post-deadline S3 durability delay share
    that margin; their combined duration must not exhaust it.
  - **Where we make it:** `LogWriter::write` captures the monotonic renewal time
    immediately before `LogRecord::new` captures the signed wall-clock time, and
    `LatestHeartbeatTime` subtracts the skew budget from the writer's fence.
    Heartbeat readers derive inactivity from the signed timestamp and the full
    quiet period.
- **Assumption 2: monotonic time advances across platform suspension.**
  - **What it is:** A paused enclave cannot resume with its local write deadline
    still artificially in the future.
  - **Where we make it:** `LatestHeartbeatTime` and all writer deadlines use
    `tokio::time::Instant`; the fencing proof requires this clock to advance
    while the platform is suspended.
- **Assumption 3: suspension does not resume execution within one future poll.**
  - **What it is:** Execution does not pause between a deadline check and
    network transmission, or between the final time check and result
    propagation.
  - **Where we make it:** `complete_before_attempt_deadline` checks the timer
    before polling the S3 future and checks time again after that future
    completes, but cannot inspect execution inside one poll.
- **Assumption 4: S3 does not make a timed-out request durable arbitrarily
  later.**
  - **What it is:** Cancelling a request future cannot retract a PUT already
    accepted by S3. If that PUT becomes durable after its local deadline, the
    delay plus any reader-ahead clock skew remains within
    `ACTIVATING_READER_CLOCK_SKEW_BUDGET`.
  - **Where we make it:** `complete_before_attempt_deadline` drops the S3 future
    when its timer wins.

## S3 log key format

Canonical key layout:

- `init/{session_id}/01-oi-attestation-unsigned.json`
- `init/{session_id}/02-oi-guardian-info.json`
- `init/{session_id}/03-pi-enclave-fully-initialized.json`
- `init/{session_id}/04-oa-activated.json`
- `heartbeat/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}/{session_id}-{counter:020}.json`
- `withdraw/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}/success-{seq:020}-{session_id}-wid{wid}.json`
- `withdraw/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}/failure-{session_id}-wid{wid}-{rand32}.json`
- `kp-shares/proposed/{session_id}.json`
- `ceremony/{sharing_seq:020}-{session_id}.json`
- `kp-shares/{sharing_seq:020}/{cert_seq:020}-{session_id}.json`
- `genesis/record.json`
- `committee-update/{new_epoch:020}-{session_id}.json`
- `committee-update/failure-{proposed_epoch:020}-{session_id}-{rand32}.json`

Where:

- `session_id` is the first 16 hex chars of the enclave ephemeral signing pubkey (lowercase). Acts as a short per-session tag in keys; full pubkey verification still happens via the signed log payload (`SessionID::HEX_LEN` in `hashi-types`).
- `counter` is a zero-padded decimal sequence number (used in heartbeats only).
- `seq` (in `withdraw/`) is the zero-padded limiter sequence number consumed by the withdrawal.
- `sharing_seq` (in `ceremony/`) is a zero-padded rotation counter — completed setup publishes `0`; each completed KP-set rotation appends `prev+1`.
- `cert_seq` (in `kp-shares/`) is a zero-padded recipient-cert state counter within one `sharing_seq`. Setup/rotation write `0`; future individual KP cert rotations append higher values.
- `new_epoch` / `proposed_epoch` (in `committee-update/`) are the zero-padded committee epoch numbers — `new_epoch` is the just-applied epoch for successes; `proposed_epoch` is the requested epoch for failures. Hashi reconfig is sparse, so neither is guaranteed to be `from_epoch + 1`.
- `rand32` is a random 32-hex suffix to avoid key collisions (failures only — successes are uniquely keyed by seq).

## Stream semantics

- `init` logs are grouped per session and numerically ordered by lifecycle step.
- `heartbeat` logs are hour-partitioned and strictly ordered per session.
- `withdraw` logs are hour-partitioned. Successes are seq-sorted within a bucket so the KP rotating in the next enclave can recover limiter state by reading the lexicographically last success key.
- `kp-shares/proposed` contains one session-addressed ceremony proposal with the ceremony metadata and initial encrypted KP shares. Ceremony participants read this record before confirmation. Proposals use the short object-lock policy and are not authoritative serving state.
- `ceremony` logs are flat (not date-partitioned) and contain only completed ceremonies. After every KP confirms a proposal, the guardian writes its initial finalized `kp-shares` state and then its `CeremonyLogMessage`; the ceremony write is the commit record. `NewKey { instance }` represents genesis (`sharing_seq=0`) and `Rotate { old_instance, new_instance }` advances `sharing_seq` by one. A rotation records the `old_instance` it consumed so the chain is auditable from the log alone. Readers select the lexicographically last ceremony as the current authoritative instance.
- Finalized `kp-shares` logs carry the current encrypted KP share state for a completed `sharing_seq`. Setup and KP-set rotation publish `cert_seq=0` during ceremony completion; individual KP cert rotations append higher `cert_seq` entries. Each share id has one recipient fingerprint and one PGP-encrypted ciphertext. Readers take the lexicographically last entry under `kp-shares/{sharing_seq:020}/`. Integrity is the enclave signature, not S3 immutability, so these get only a short object lock (a fetch-window guarantee) and stay readable until purged.
- `genesis` is a fixed singleton record carrying the first-deploy committee, Hashi object id, and MPC master `G` after KP-authorized PI reaches threshold, before any `committee-update/` success exists.
- `committee-update` logs are flat (not date-partitioned). Successes are epoch-sorted; failures lead with `failure-` so all successes sort first — the lex-last non-`failure-` key is the latest successfully-applied epoch.

## Why this layout

- `init/{session_id}-...` keeps init logs session-addressable.
- `heartbeat/...` and `withdraw/...` date partitions support efficient hour-based polling.
- `ceremony/` and `committee-update/` are flat because the consumer always wants "latest"; a lex sort over the whole prefix is cheap and gives that directly. `kp-shares/proposed/` is session-addressed because a live ceremony has exactly one proposal. Finalized `kp-shares/` is nested by `sharing_seq` because readers want the latest cert state within one current sharing instance. `genesis/record.json` is fixed because there is at most one bootstrap record.
- Zero-padding (`{seq:020}` in `withdraw/`, `{sharing_seq:020}` in `ceremony/`, `{cert_seq:020}` in `kp-shares/`, `{new_epoch:020}` in `committee-update/`) makes lexicographic order over the keys equal seq/epoch order. The signed log payload embeds the same value, so a fetched object's filename and content can be cross-checked.
- Prefixes (`init`, `heartbeat`, `withdraw`, `ceremony`, `kp-shares`, `genesis`, `committee-update`) allow independent S3 deletion policies.
